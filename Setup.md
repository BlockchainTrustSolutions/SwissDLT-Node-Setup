# Setup a Signer Node

As setting up a signer node might be a technical task, I tried to simplify it as much as possible. Still, if something is unclear or you need support, contact me anytime at [silas.stulz@bcts.ch](mailto:silas.stulz@bcts.ch?subject=SwissDLT Setup Support)

There are currently two possible ways to run a SwissDLT node, in a container or a source installation. For either of them you need to setup a VM.

## 1. Virtual Machine Setup

## 2. Virtual Machine installation

- Connect to your virtual machine you setup via SSH.


- Update the system:

  ```sudo apt-get update```

- Install geth

  ```sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum```

  ```sudo apt-get install ethereum```

- 

## 3. Docker Setup
